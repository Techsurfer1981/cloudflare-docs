<div class="special-class" markdown="1">

You can use AND and OR logical operators to build complex policies. The **And** logical operator checks if users meet all of the criteria, while the **Or** logical operator checks if users meet one of the criteria.

The OR operator will only work with conditions of the same expression type. For example, you cannot compare conditions in **Traffic** with conditions in $1.
