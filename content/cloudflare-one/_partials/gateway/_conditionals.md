<div class="special-class" markdown="1">

The **And** logical operator checks if users match all of the conditions in the expression, while the **Or** logical operator checks if users match any of the conditions in the expression.

The **Or** operator will only work with conditions in the same expression group. For example, you cannot compare conditions in **Traffic** with conditions in $1.
