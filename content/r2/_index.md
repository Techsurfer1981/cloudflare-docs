# Cloudflare R2

You can use R2 for multiple scenarios, including but not limited to:

- Storage for podcast episodes
- Storage for cloud-native applications
- Cloud storage for web content
- Data lakes (analytics and big data)
- Cloud storage output for large batch processes, such as machine learning model artifacts or data sets
